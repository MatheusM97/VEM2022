(cla).

  * if you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual cla]
    (http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
  * if you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate cla]
    (http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate cla and
instructions for how to sign and return it. once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.

## contributing a patch

1. sign a contributor license agreement, if you have not yet done so (see
   details above).
1. create your change to the repo in question.
    * fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
    * ensure that your code is clear and comprehensible.
    * ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.
1. submit a pull request.
1. the repo owner will review your request. if it is approved, the change will

   useful comments.

## contributing a new sample app

1. sign a contributor license agreement, if you have not yet done so (see
   details above).
1. create your own repo for your app following this naming convention:
    * mirror-{app-name}-{language or platform}
    * apps: quickstart, photohunt-server, photohunt-client
    * example:  mirror-quickstart-android
    * for multi-language apps, concatenate the primary languages like this:
      mirror-photohunt-server-java-python.

1. create your sample app in this repo.
    * be sure to clone the readme.md, contributing.md and license files from the
      googlesamples repo.
    * ensure that your code is clear and comprehensible.
    * ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.
    * instructional value is the top priority when evaluating new app proposals for
      this collection of repos.
1. submit a request to fork your repo in googlesamples organization.

### before you contribute

before we can use your code, you must sign the
[google individual contributor license agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)
(cla), which you can do online. the cla is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. we also
need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. you don't have to sign
the cla until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### code reviews

all submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. we
use github pull requests for this purpose.

### the small print

contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the software grant and corporate contributor license agreement.

# contributor license agreements

we'd love to accept your code patches! however, before we can take them, we have to clear a couple of legal hurdles.

- please fill out either the individual or corporate contributor license agreement.
  - if you are an individual writing original source code and are sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an individual cla available at https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual.
  - if you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work to this client library, then you'll need to sign a corporate cla available at https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate.

follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate cla and instructions on how to sign and return it. once we receive the cla, we'll add you to the official list of contributors and will be able to accept your patches.

# submitting patches

- sign a contributor license agreement (see above).
- create an issue on the library issue tracker if there isn't one already. use this issue to co-ordinate the changes with the library maintainer.
- fork the library, make the changes and send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
- the library maintainer will work with you to review and apply the patch.

# if you can't become a contributor

if you can't become a contributor, but wish to share some code that illustrates an issue / shows how an issue may be fixed, then you can attach your changes on the issue tracker. we will use this code to troubleshoot the issue and fix it, but will not use this code in the library unless the steps to submit patches are done.

### before you contribute
before we can use your code, you must sign the
[google individual contributor license agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)
(cla), which you can do online. the cla is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. we also
need to be sure of various other things â€” for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. you don't have to sign
the cla until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### code reviews
all submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. we
use github pull requests for this purpose.

### the small print
contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the software grant and corporate contributor license agreement. # how to become a contributor and submit your own code
