## csharp samples

#### building the csharp samples
to build all the csharp samples without opening visual studio, you can use this simple script:
```
for /r %f in (*.sln) do (dotnet build "%f")
```

if you want to write the output of the build to a file you can tack on ` >> mybuild.tmp` to the end of the command.

#### update the azure.batch nuget project reference
the azure batch samples should be kept up to date with the latest azure.batch nuget package.

##### using a text replace
the following commands can be used to perform the textual replace: `rep.exe -find:"<packagereference include=\"microsoft.azure.batch\" version=\"10.0.0\" />" -replace:"<packagereference include=\"microsoft.azure.batch\" version=\"12.0.0\" />" -r *.csproj`

===============================================

so, you want to contribute on a client library or sample for one of the microsoft cognitive services.
here's what you need to know.

1. each sdk should include both a client library and a sample showing the api in action

2. when working on an sdk, it's important that we are consistent from project to project, so we ask you to follow the coding guidelines below:

   - windows [(coding guidelines for c#)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff926074.aspx) -- also reference our [common windows code](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-common-windows) for building samples

   - android [(coding guidelines for java)](<http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html>)

   - ios objective-c [(coding guidelines for cocoa)](<https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/codingguidelines/codingguidelines.html>)

   - optional: client javascript ([coding guidelines for npm](<https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/coding-style>))

3. samples are important for illustrating how to actually call into the api.
   samples should be as visual and reusable as possible.

   - do:

     - create a ui sample when possible.

     - make your sample user friendly. expect that developers will want to try different mainline scenarios and key apis.

     - create code that's easy for other developers to copy/paste into their own solutions

   - consider:

     - adding ui to allow devs to quickly copy/paste subscription keys, instead of updating them in the code or using a config file.
       the faceapi-wpf-samples.sln provides an example.

   - don't:

     - leave your subscription key in the source of samples. you do not want your key to be abused by others.

happy coding!

===============================================
so, you want to contribute on a client library or sample for one of the microsoft cognitive services.
here's what you need to know.

1.  each sdk should include both a client library and a sample showing the api in
    action

2.  when working on an sdk, it's important that we are consistent from project to project, so we ask you to follow the coding guidelines below:

    -   windows [(coding guidelines for c#)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff926074.aspx) -- also reference our [common windows code](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-common-windows) for building samples

    -   android [(coding guidelines for
        java)](<http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html>)

    -   ios objective-c [(coding guidelines for
        cocoa)](<https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/codingguidelines/codingguidelines.html>)

    -   optional: client javascript ([coding guidelines for
        npm](<https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/coding-style>))

3.  samples are important for illustrating how to actually call into the api.
    samples should be as visual and reusable as possible.

    - do:

        -   create a ui sample when possible.

        -   make your sample user friendly. expect that developers will want to try
        different mainline scenarios and key apis.

        -   create code that's easy for other developers to copy/paste into their
        own solutions

    - consider:

        -   adding ui to allow devs to quickly copy/paste subscription keys, instead
        of updating them in the code or using a config file. the
        faceapi-wpf-samples.sln provides an example.

    - don't:

        -   leave your subscription key in the source of samples. you do not want your key to be abused by others.

happy coding!

all contributions to appauth for android are welcome!

note that as this library is planned to be used in high-profile production code,
we insist on a very high standards for the code and design, but don't feel shy:
discuss your plans over 
[github issues](https://github.com/openid/appauth-android/issues) and the
[mailing list](http://lists.openid.net/mailman/listinfo/openid-specs-ab), and
send in those pull requests!

# signing the agreements

in order to contribute to this project, you need to execute two legal agreements
that cover your contributions.  pull requests from users who have not signed
these agreements will not be merged.

## execute the contributor license agreement (cla)

1. visit http://openid.net/contribution-license-agreement/
2. tap *execute openid foundation contribution license agreement* for the
   version relevant to you (individual or corporate).
3. follow the instructions to sign the agreement.

## execute the working group contribution agreement

in addition to the code license agreement, the openid foundation also requires
a working group contribution agreement to cover any contributions you may make
towards the openid connect spec itself (e.g. in comments, bug reports, feature
requests).

1. visit http://openid.net/intellectual-property/
2. tap *execute contributor agreement by electronic signature* in the box
   marked *resources*.
3. follow the instructions to sign the document, state `openid ab/connect` as

# making a pull request

## before you start

before you work on a big new feature, get in touch to make sure that your work
is inline with the direction of the project and get input on your architecture.
you can file an [issue](https://github.com/openid/appauth-android/issues)
discussing your proposal, or email the 
[list](http://lists.openid.net/mailman/listinfo/openid-specs-ab). 

## coding standards

the appauth library follows the
[google coding style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for
the java language. please review your own code for adherence to the standard
and make sure to run the `check` gradle target.

## pull request reviews

all pull requests, even by members who have repository write access need to be
reviewed and marked as "lgtm" before they will be merged.

 # how to contribute

support and contributions from the open source community are essential for keeping
mean.js up to date and always improving! there are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow to keep the project consistent, as well as allow us to keep
maintaining mean.js in a reasonable amount of time.

## creating an issue

before you create a new issue:
* check the [issues](https://github.com/meanjs/mean/issues) on github to ensure one doesn't already exist.
* clearly describe the issue, including the steps to reproduce the issue.
* if it's a new feature, enhancement, or restructure, explain your reasoning on why you think it should be added, as well as a particular use case.

## making changes

* create a topic branch from the master branch.
* check for unnecessary whitespace / changes with `git diff --check` before committing.
	* also check that your code is formatted properly with spaces (hint: use [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/))
* keep git commit messages clear and appropriate
	* if possible, please "squash" your commits to as few commits as possible/reasonable such as one commit for implementation, one for tests, and one for documentation before finally squashing to one commit when getting the lgtm from a collaborator.
  * follow the commit message guidelines below.
* make sure you have added any tests necessary to test your code.
	* run __all__ the tests to ensure nothing else was accidently broken.
	* don't rely on the existing tests to see if you've broken code elsewhere; test the changes you made in a browser too!
* update the documentation to go along with any changes in functionality / improvements in a separate pull request against the gh-pages branch.

## commit message guidelines
```
header
blank line
body
blank line
footer

the header should look like:
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

the body should have any necessary detailed info about the commit:
an example, references as to where this idea came from, etc.

the footer should have all the issues tagged:
fixes #123, fixes #456

so a commit should like like:
feat(users): add new yahoo authentication

yahoo authentication idea proposed by @codydaig
example implementation in file.js

fixes #82
```

* types:
  * feat - features, enhancements, and overall improvements
  * fix - fixes, bugs, hotfixs, etc...
  * doc - changes to the documentation and doesn't actually touch any code.
* scope:
  * the scope should be where the change took place.
  * examples: users, core, config, articles
* subject:
  * the subject line should be clear and concise as to what is being accomplished in the commit.
* general rules:
  * no line in the commit message can be longer than 80 characters.
* refrence: [angular conventions](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/conventions/angular.md)


## submitting the pull request

* push your changes to your topic branch on your fork of the repo.
* submit a pull request from your topic branch to the master branch on the mean.js repository.
* be sure to tag any issues your pull request is taking care of / contributing to.
	* by adding "closes #xyz" to a commit message will auto close the issue once the pull request is merged in.
* small changes are usually accepted and merged in within a week (provided that 2 collaborators give the okay)
* larger changes usually spark further discussion and possible changes prior to being merged in.

## documentation (meanjs.org)

the code for the documentation and the website are located in the meanjs/mean repo on the gh-pages branch. the website is hosted by github pages and generated using jekyll. see the readme in the gh-pages branch for more information on how to get your dev enviorment set-up.

## generating a new release

for those who will be generating releases:
* don't forget to update the changelog!
  * install the changelog cli tool: `npm install conventional-changelog-cli`
  * generate the updated changelog `node_modules/.bin/conventional-changelog -r 1 > /tmp/release && cat changelog.md >> /tmp/release && cat /tmp/release > changelog.md && rm /tmp/release`
	* review, and commit changes

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

this project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  most contributions require you to agree to a
contributor license agreement (cla) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. for details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

when you submit a pull request, a cla-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a cla and decorate the pr appropriately (e.g., label, comment). simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. you will only need to do this once across all repos using our cla.

this project has adopted the [microsoft open source code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

 - [code of conduct](#coc)
 - [issues and bugs](#issue)
 - [feature requests](#feature)
 - [submission guidelines](#submit)

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

- submit feedback on [this sample page](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/compute-java-manage-resources-from-vm-with-msi-in-aad-group/) whether it was helpful or not.  
- submit issues through [issue tracker](https://github.com/azure-samples/compute-java-manage-resources-from-vm-with-msi-in-aad-group/issues) on github. we are actively monitoring the issues and improving our samples.
- if you wish to make code changes to samples, or contribute something new, please follow the [github forks / pull requests model](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/): fork the sample repo, make the change and propose it back by submitting a pull request. # contributing to [project-title]

this project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  most contributions require you to agree to a
contributor license agreement (cla) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. for details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

when you submit a pull request, a cla-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a cla and decorate the pr appropriately (e.g., label, comment). simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. you will only need to do this once across all repos using our cla.

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

# <a name="guidance"></a> guidance for writing new samples

this repo provides samples to help developers understand how to interact with azure services using the azure sdk for go. the following guidance for creating samples helps ensure consistency across our supported services.

* any service in [`azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/...`][1] is eligible for a folder under `sdk` in this repo (`azure-sdk-for-go-samples`).
* each sub-folder under the above top-level folder is a sample of common operations typically executed for that service and should contain a `main.go` file which can be executed directly. for example, the `sdk/resourcemanager/compute` directory is arranged as below.

```
  compute/
      availablilityset
          go.mod
          go.sum
          license.txt
          main.go
          readme.md
      create_vm
          ...
      ...

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f

if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

we monitor the github issues section specifically for bugs found with our samples, however we will reply to questions asked using github issues too.

the azure digital twins team monitors stack overflow via the [azure-digital-twins](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-digital-twins) tag. it is a great place to ask questions about [azure digital twins](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/digital-twins/).

## <a name="bug"></a> file a bug (code or documentation)

bugs are definitely something we want to hear about! please [open an issue](https://github.com/azure-samples/digital-twins-samples-csharp/issues/new) on github and we'll try address it as fast as possible.  when creating the issue, please help us by filling out as much of the requested info as possible.

our samples are entirely open-source and we do accept pull-requests if you feel like taking a stab at fixing the bug. please be sure to file an issues first and mention the relevant issue number in your pull request description.

## <a name="feature"></a> request a feature
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/azure-samples/digital-twins-samples-csharp/issues/new) to the github repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

## <a name="contribute"></a> contribute changes

we try to maintain a high bar for code quality and maintainability, we request that all new code samples are accompanied by documentation, example scenarios, and tests (for non trivial samples).

features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/azure-samples/hybrid-storage-jave-manage-storage-accounts/issues/new.

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/azure-samples/hybrid-storage-jave-manage-storage-accounts/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

that's it! thank you for your contribution!
 we'll be glad to accept patches and contributions to the project. there are just few guidelines we ask to follow.

contribution license agreement
==============================

if you want/plan to contribute, we ask you to sign a [cla](https://cla.microsoft.com/) (contribution license agreement).  a friendly bot will remind you about it when you submit a pull-request.

submitting a contribution
=========================

it's generally best to start by [opening a new issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue) describing the work you intend to submit. even for minor tasks, it's helpful to know what contributors are working on. please mention in the initial issue that you are planning to work on it, so that it can be assigned to you.

follow the usual github flow process of [forking the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), and setup a new branch to work in. each group of changes should be done in separate branches, in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the changes related to one issue.

any significant change should almost always be accompanied by tests. look at the existing tests to see the testing approach and style used.  

follow the project coding style, to ensure consistency and quick code reviews.  we heavily rely on dependency injection using *autofac* and thus ask to follow the same paradigm when adding new code.

do your best to have clear commit messages for each change, in order to keep consistency throughout the project. reference the issue number (#num). a good commit message serves at least these purposes:
* speed up the pull request review process
* help future developers to understand the purpose of your code
* help the maintainer write release notes

one-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
```
$ git commit -m "a brief summary of the commit
>
> a paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

finally, push the commits to your fork, submit a pull request, wait for all gates to pass and fix any issues found as part of the gate process.  the team might ask for some [changes](https://help.github.com/articles/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) before merging the pull request. # contributing to [project-title]

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/azure-samples/hybrid-compute-python-manage-vm/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/azure-samples/hybrid-compute-python-manage-vm/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/azure-samples/hybrid-compute-java-create-vm-from-custom-image/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/azure-samples/hybrid-compute-java-create-vm-from-custom-image/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

a typical contribution will be a bug fix or a new power skill. new power skills should reproduce the existing skills' directory and file structure. as such, each skill should:

* be a new project, created under the directory for the relevant category (text, geo, etc.)
* have its own `readme.md` file describing the skill's functionality, and the schema for inputs and outputs
* have its own `azuredeploy.json` azure resource manager (arm) template and corresponding "publish to azure" button. you should be able to start from [an existing arm template](geo/geopointfromname/azuredeploy.json) and [readme.md](geo/geopointfromname/readme.md), then modify the variables section of the former to point to your new project file and the target url of the button in the latter to point to the template file.

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/azure-samples/functions-java-push-static-contents-to-cdn/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/azure-samples/functions-java-push-static-contents-to-cdn/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?

you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

- **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue

before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

- **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
- **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
- **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
- **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
- **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
- **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
- **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: <https://github.com/[organization-name>]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)

before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

- search the repository (<https://github.com/[organization-name>]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

- make your changes in a new git fork:

- commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
- push your fork to github:
- in github, create a pull request
- if we suggest changes then:
  - make the required updates.
  - rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

 # how to contribute
first of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. we've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. you can help us do more.

## getting started

### check out the roadmap

we have some functionalities in mind and we have issued them and there is a *milestone* label available on the issue. if there is a bug or a feature that is not listed in the **issues** page or there is no one assigned to the issue, feel free to fix/add it! although it's better to discuss it in the issue or create a new issue for it so there is no confilcting code.

### writing some code!

contributing to a project on azuredevops/github is pretty straight forward. if this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

- fork this repo.

and that's it! read the code available and change the part you don't like! you're change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

if you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **master**. it would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

when you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. we would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

### tests

we've written tests and you can run them to assure the stability of the code. if you're adding a new functionality please write a test for it.

### documentation

every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. if you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented. # contributing to [project-title]

every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. 
if you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, 
please document it. # contributing guidelines

the azure service operator project accepts contributions via github pull requests. this document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

please see also the [azure service operator developer guide](docs/community/developer-guide.md).

## contributor license agreements

we'd love to accept your patches! before we can take them, we have to jump a
couple of legal hurdles.

the [microsoft cla](https://cla.microsoft.com/) must be signed by all contributors. please fill out either the individual or corporate contributor license agreement (cla). once you are cla'ed, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

***note***: only original source code from you and other people that have
signed the cla can be accepted into the repository.

## support channels

this is an open source project and as such no formal support is available. however, like all good open source projects we do offer "best effort" support through github issues.

github issues can be filed here - https://github.com/azure/azure-service-operator/issues

before opening a new issue or submitting a new pull request, it's helpful to search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.

## issues

issues are used as the primary method for tracking anything to do with the azure service operator project.

### issue lifecycle

the issue lifecycle is mainly driven by the core maintainers, but is good information for those contributing to the project. all issue types follow the same general lifecycle. differences are noted below.
1. issue creation
2. triage
    - the maintainer in charge of triaging will apply the proper labels for the issue. this includes labels for priority, type, and metadata. if additional
    labels are needed in the future, we will add them.
    - (if needed) clean up the title to succinctly and clearly state the issue. also ensure that proposals are prefaced with "proposal".
3. discussion
    - "feature" and "bug" issues should be connected to the pr that resolves it.
    - whoever is working on a "feature" or "bug" issue (whether a maintainer or someone from the community), should either assign the issue to themself or make a comment in the issue saying that they are taking it.
    - "proposal" and "question" issues should stay open until resolved or if they have not been active for more than 30 days. this will help keep the issue queue to a manageable size and reduce noise. should the issue need to stay open, the `keep open` label can be added.
4. issue closure

## how to contribute a patch

1. if you haven't already done so, sign a contributor license agreement (see details above).
2. fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
3. submit a pull request.

## reporting security issues

microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our github organizations, including this one.

### <a name="samplerequirements"></a> requirements for adding a sample

* fill the \<title\> tag of the sample with a discription title in the format "[your sample title] - azure maps web sdk samples".
* add a short discription to the description meta tag. this is used to populate the description on the card and also a seo optimization.
* add related keywords to the keyword meta tag. this is used for search and also a seo optimization.
* create a screenshot of your sample that is 350px width and 225px tall and save it in the siteresources/screenshots folder with the name of your sample but with spaces replaced with dashes. alternatively run the samplelistbuilder app and it will attempt to capture a screenshot automatically. if your sample doesn't have a ui or not much of one, go into the samplelistbuilder/samplelisthelper.cs file and add the name of the sample to the screenshotstoignore list.
* if you add a new category folder for samples, add it to categoryfolders list with a short discription (will be dispayed on index.html) in the samplelistbuilder/samplelisthelper.cs file.
* ensure that all local urls are relative (../) and not based off the root (/). this will ensure that the resource will be accessible if the sample file is openned in a browser directly without being hosted on localhost.
* when you are done adding your sample, run the samplelistbuilder to update the index.html.
* if you simple want to add a link to the external samples list, add it to the samplelistbuilder/samplelisthelper.cs file.
* be sure to remove your azure maps key before checking in.

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!
 # contributing to voice assistant

this project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  most contributions require you to agree to a
contributor license agreement (cla) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. for details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

when you submit a pull request, a cla-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a cla and decorate the pr appropriately (e.g., label, comment). simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. you will only need to do this once across all repos using our cla.

this project has adopted the [microsoft open source code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
for more information see the [code of conduct faq](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or
contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

 - [issues and bugs](#issue)
 - [feature requests](#feature)
 - [submission guidelines](#submit)

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/azure-samples/cognitive-services-voice-assistant/issues/new.

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/azure-samples/cognitive-services-voice-assistant/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

 # how to contribute
first of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. we've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. you can help us do more.

## getting started

### check out the roadmap

we have some functionalities in mind and we have issued them and there is a *milestone* label available on the issue. if there is a bug or a feature that is not listed in the **issues** page or there is no one assigned to the issue, feel free to fix/add it! although it's better to discuss it in the issue or create a new issue for it so there is no confilcting code.

### writing some code!

contributing to a project on azuredevops/github is pretty straight forward. if this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

- fork this repo.

and that's it! read the code available and change the part you don't like! you're change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

if you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **master**. it would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

when you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. we would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

### tests

we've written tests and you can run them to assure the stability of the code. if you're adding a new functionality please write a test for it.

### documentation

every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. if you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented. # contributing to [project-title]

## submission guidelines

### submitting an issue

before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

- **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
- **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
- **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
- **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
- **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or an unambiguous set of steps
- **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
- **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: <https://github.com/[organization-name>]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### submitting a pull request

before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

- search the repository (<https://github.com/[organization-name>]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

- make your changes in a new git fork:

- commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
- push your fork to github:
- in github, create a pull request
- if we suggest changes then:
  - make the required updates.
  - rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/azure-samples/quickstart-spring-data-r2dbc-mysql/issues/new].

* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

## <a name="purpose"></a>sample app purpose
sample apps are built to help showcase the capabilities of azure communication services. 
this app uses all best practices and follows limitations related to the service.
as you contribute make sure to follow service guidelines or your work might not be accepted.
the app is built on top of the existing azure communiation services sdks, and will not diverge from the capabilities offered by the sdk.
this means that if the feature desired is not supported on the sdk, please don't try to hack it into the sample. 

the sample is continously updated as new features are added to the underlying sdks and feel free to contribute any features that are supported.
in the case of the calling app, two samples are available, one on the `main` branch and another on the `public-preview` branch. 
if the feature you are looking to add is currently in `public preview`, meaning it is only available on `beta` packages, make sure to contribute to the correct branch.

before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase main -i
    git push -f
    ```

help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/azure-samples/microsoft-identity-express/issues/new.

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/azure-samples/microsoft-identity-express/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/azure-samples/jboss-on-aro-jakartaee/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/azure-samples/jboss-on-aro-jakartaee/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!

## <a name="coc"></a> code of conduct
help us keep this project open and inclusive. please read and follow our [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## <a name="issue"></a> found an issue?
if you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github repository. even better, you can
[submit a pull request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> want a feature?
you can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to the github
repository. if you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

* **small features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a pull request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> submission guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> submitting an issue
before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

if your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
* **version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
* **motivation for or use case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
* **browsers and operating system** - is this a problem with all browsers?
* **reproduce the error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
* **related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **suggest a fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

you can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link: https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/issues/new].

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> submitting a pull request (pr)
before you submit your pull request (pr) consider the following guidelines:

* search the repository (https://github.com/[organization-name]/[repository-name]/pulls) for an open or closed pr
  that relates to your submission. you don't want to duplicate effort.

* make your changes in a new git fork:

* commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
* push your fork to github:
* in github, create a pull request
* if we suggest changes then:
  * make the required updates.
  * rebase your fork and force push to your github repository (this will update your pull request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

that's it! thank you for your contribution!
