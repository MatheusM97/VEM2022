### Before you contribute

Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other things—for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.

### The small print

Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement.

# Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your code patches! However, before we can take them, we have to clear a couple of legal hurdles.

- Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement.
  - If you are an individual writing original source code and are sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an individual CLA available at https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual.
  - If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work to this client library, then you'll need to sign a corporate CLA available at https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate.

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions on how to sign and return it. Once we receive the CLA, we'll add you to the official list of contributors and will be able to accept your patches.

# Submitting Patches

- Sign a Contributor License Agreement (see above).
- Create an issue on the library issue tracker if there isn't one already. Use this issue to co-ordinate the changes with the library maintainer.

- The library maintainer will work with you to review and apply the patch.

# If you can't become a contributor

If you can't become a contributor, but wish to share some code that illustrates an issue / shows how an issue may be fixed, then you can attach your changes on the issue tracker. We will use this code to troubleshoot the issue and fix it, but will not use this code in the library unless the steps to submit patches are done.

### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other things — for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.

### The small print
Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement."

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
